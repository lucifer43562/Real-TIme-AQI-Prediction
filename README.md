I have provided the xml file which you can convert to csv file and i have performed eda and other regression methods
But if you want to get the real time AQI then do following steps:
https://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/. open this link and get your own api token
Replace the given api token with the one you will get from the above link i providedand  i have mentioned where to put 
then just run it you will get real time AQI by just entering the state(it is for major states not for evry state)
